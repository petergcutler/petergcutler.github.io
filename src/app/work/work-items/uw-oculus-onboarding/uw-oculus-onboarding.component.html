      We worked with the Oculus platform to understand how first-time users would adapt to a VR interface with no prior experience. We found that on-boarding experiences were critical &mdash; both to the VR platform and to individual applications. Specifically, tutorial experiences should also be replayable, accessible, and navigable.

      VR Applications
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the outset of the project, we decided to focus on two Oculus applications:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">
          First Contact</a> &mdash; the official on-boarding experience provided by Oculus
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/">
          Tilt Brush</a> &mdash; a 3d design application designed for VR
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We wanted to test an interface-driven product, rather than a game. I had purchased the Rift back when it launched and used it for 3d design &mdash; as a team, we explored Tilt Brush together and decided it was a great candidate.

      Platform and Application On-boarding
    </h3>
    <p>
      We determined that we couldn't drop users into a complex application like Tilt Brush without on-boarding for the platform. As a result, we incorporated First Contact into our design. We wanted to explore how the user perceived this experience, and how well it taught them the necessary basics of controlling the platform.

      Heuristic Evaluation
    </h2>
    <p>
      We used a <a class="work-body-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">heuristic analysis</a> of our applications to find worthwhile avenues to explore. We focused on a few at the outset:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Visibility of System Status</span>: in First Contact, we found some of us were confused about what we should be doing. In Tilt Brush, we found a lack of clarity around our current tool selections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Consistency and standards</span>: input expectations changed from app to app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Error Prevention</span>: both applications lead the user toward error, often through a lack of clear direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</span>: menus and environments were visually noisy and sometimes overwhelming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Help and Documentation</span>: we found poor access to documentation within Tilt Brush.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Research Planning
    </h2>
    <p>
      To develop a clearly-scoped research plan, we prioritized problems that were foundational, rather than those that could be attributed to common, emerging issues in VR. At this time, it's unrealistic that all VR apps will adhere to "standards" for controls and interfaces &mdash; each app will require some adjusting. We focused on education and on-boarding problems, and organized the following research questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        What challenges do first-time users run into while using the Oculus platform?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does ease of use for each app impact satisfaction for the entire experience?
      </li>
      <li>
        How easily and successfully do first-time users interact with First Contact and Tilt Brush?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="work-body-h3">
      Components of the Research Plan
    </h3>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Target users, with inclusion and exclusion criteria
      </li>
      <li>
        Methodology, including moderation (in-person), duration, number of participants, protocols, and interview structure (e.g., pre-test interview, post-task interview)
      </li>
      <li>
        Task lists, including starting state and success state
      </li>
      <li>
        Data collection goals, including quantitative data, qualitative data, subjective/objective evaluation, and collection methodology (e.g., Think Aloud Protocol, or Likert scales)
      </li>
      <li>
        Test logistics, equipment, location details
      </li>
      <li>
        Results, reporting, deliverables, and timeline
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Based on our plan, we began to recruit and screen our participants. Meanwhile, we prepared our session script and data collection documents.

      Running the Usability Study
    </h2>
    <p>
      We brought 8 individuals to Facebook's offices for our study. Each of us moderated two, one-hour sessions with participants.

    </div>
    <p>
      We each navigated many of the unique hurdles to testing in VR:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Ensuring participants were comfortable among strangers, while blind to their surroundings
      </li>
      <li>
        Moderating participants who can't see you
      </li>
      <li>
        Exposing participants to a completely foreign interface, and persistently encouraging and exploring Think-Aloud dialogue
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also conducted the interviews outlined in our research plan -- pre and post-test, as well as post-task and post-application interviews. During our teammates' sessions, we aided in note-taking, chaperoning participants with the equipment, noting quantitative success/failure, and asking select follow-up questions during interviews.

      Analysis and Organizing Findings
    </h2>
    <p>
      We began to analyze our findings after testing our first participant. Typically, we would each note our own findings, and then begin to compare after reflecting independently. By the time we completed our eighth and final test, we had a growing body of findings, and were approaching consensus among the most severe issues.

    <p>
      We met a number of times following the study to prioritize our findings, put together affinity diagrams, and draft out our presentation and report.

      This is a detailed report, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about it. We uncovered many actionable findings across both First Contact and Tilt Brush.

      For me personally, I've enjoyed working with VR for many years, and the process of conducting this research only made me more certain about the exciting questions we can continue to explore.
