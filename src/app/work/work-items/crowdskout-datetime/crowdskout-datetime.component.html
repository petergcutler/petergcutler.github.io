      As we grew the Crowdskout app to support more complex time-series graphs and other date & time dependent inputs, we encountered a need to overhaul our date & time UI and data treatment. I researched the ISO spec and developed a new interface to handle these selections.

      ISO8601 and Moment.js
    </h2>
    <p>
      Using the <a class="basic-link" target="_blank" href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a> library as a backbone for transforming and handling our date & datetime data, I built a custom component for accepting input data, transforming, and saving data in ISO8601 format. The component was built to be a flexible AngularJS directive that could easily shift implementations between date alone, or datetime, depending on varying needs.

        borderOn="true">

      Crowdskout's date & time component is a complex, interactive module within the application. If you have any questions, I'm happy to walk through the design and code involved. Thanks for reading.
