      I joined Crowdskout in 2015 with a directive to overhaul Crowdskout's data visualization system. Working with a team of engineers, I researched and built the foundations of the system. The system was designed so that a novice user could quickly learn and operate it to design and deliver complex visualizations without dedicated training.

      Building a System with D3 and AmCharts
    </h2>
    <p>
      We built the system using a mix of <a class="basic-link" target="_blank" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> and a library called <a class="basic-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amcharts.com/">amCharts</a>, also built on D3. The visualization component integrated with the Crowdskout app as an Angular component, coded with a mix of vanilla JavaScript and AngularJS.

      Using a multi-step editor, a user could select an audience segment, criteria, and a graph type, and create a graph that could be customized or exported in a variety of ways.

    <div class="gallery-subsection">
      <lightgallery [settings]="settings" [onBeforeSlide]="onBeforeSlide" class="lg-wrapper-3">
        <a *ngFor="let gallery of galleryContents; index as i" [href]="gallery.url" class="gallery-link" [attr.data-gallery]="'gallery' + (i + 1)">
          <div class="gallery-image-container">
            <img [alt]="gallery.description" [src]="gallery.url" class="gallery-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-description">{{gallery.description}}</div>
        </a>
      </lightgallery> 
    </div>

    <p>
      Crowdskout's data visualization component is a complex, interactive module of the application. If you have any questions, I'm happy to walk through the design and code involved. Thanks for reading.
