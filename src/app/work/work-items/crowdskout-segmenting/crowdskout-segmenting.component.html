      Audience segmentation is at the heart of Crowdskout's data analytics system. In 2016, after the segmentation tool grew in complexity, we overhauled the interface to this critical tool to better support the new capabilities it offered.

      Crowdskout Profiles
    </h2>
    <p>
      Audience segments in Crowdskout are made up of deanonymized "profiles." A mock profile is shown below. Each profile is made up of hundreds of criteria, including demographic information as well as many other types of info.
    </p>

    <div class="gallery-subsection">
      <lightgallery [settings]="settings" [onBeforeSlide]="onBeforeSlide" class="lg-wrapper-2">
        <a *ngFor="let gallery of galleryContentsProfile; index as i" [href]="gallery.url" class="gallery-link" [attr.data-gallery]="'gallery' + (i + 1)">
          <div class="gallery-image-container">
            <img [alt]="gallery.description" [src]="gallery.url" class="gallery-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-description">{{gallery.description}}</div>
        </a>
      </lightgallery> 
    </div>

    <p>
      Users build segments of profiles by selecting the criteria that they want to segment on, for instance, people of a certain gender, age, and/or ethnicity. Doing so, they can find all of the profiles in their database that match these criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating a segment, Crowdskout users can monitor these different segments of profiles, and take action to contact these individuals in different ways.

      The Segmenting Feature
    </h2>
    <p>
      We updated the segmenting feature to improve the way users create and manage their audience segments.
    </p>

    <div class="gallery-subsection">
      <lightgallery [settings]="settings" [onBeforeSlide]="onBeforeSlide" class="lg-wrapper-3">
        <a *ngFor="let gallery of galleryContentsSegmenting; index as i" [href]="gallery.url" class="gallery-link" [attr.data-gallery]="'gallery' + (i + 1)">
          <div class="gallery-image-container">
            <img [alt]="gallery.description" [src]="gallery.url" class="gallery-image" />
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-description">{{gallery.description}}</div>
        </a>
      </lightgallery> 
    </div>

    <p>
      Crowdskout's segmenting component is a complex, interactive module within the application. If you have any questions, I'm happy to walk through the design and code involved. Thanks for reading.
