      I worked with a Directed Research Group in HCDE to help run a long-term evaluation of Yarn &mdash; a research iOS app for writing stories of accomplishment through personal data like running data, photos, videos, and text.
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped recruit, interview, and manage a cohort of 15 participants who used the app for four weeks each. Throughout the study, we conducted weekly surveys as well as pre- and post-study semi-structured interviews. At the end of the study, I helped analyze and synthesize the data. Our findings are under submission to the 21st ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing in 2018.

      Understanding the Research and the App
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yarn uses a structured writing experience to help people create content which aligns with their goals for sharing that others would find interesting. Yarn was specifically designed to support two types of stories of personal accomplishment: training for a running race or working on Do-It-Yourself projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset of our project, the design of the Yarn application was complete, but we had to organize and run its usability study. I joined a team with three other students to help run the study and analyze our findings.

    <p>
      We first spent some time familiarizing ourselves with the application. To contrast Yarn with an app like Runkeeper, Yarn focuses on building an extended narrative from many chapters, rather than on "individual" runs. Each run (e.g. 'Wednesday 5k') is added to an overall story (e.g. 'Training for the Boston Marathon'). The same would be true of a DIY project like building a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the text, images, and video that make up each chapter, Yarn presents a more holistic view of the overall project. This is foundational to the guiding question we were addressing: does this holistic approach to sharing improve the feedback that our participants get from their communities?
    </p>
    <p>
      After using the application for a week, and discussing the research with Daniel Epstein, the PhD candidate running the study, we began recruiting.

      Research Planning
    </h2>
    <p>
      The research around Yarn was more involved than in many stand-alone usability tests. We were recruiting a cohort to use the application for over a month, and interviewing not just our cohort of participants, but also their social contacts to understand their network's perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating our research plan, we went through a number of important steps:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Crafting a flexible timeline to allow for drop-out participants, recruitment, four weeks of application use and check-ins, as well as final interviews and analysis
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating screening surveys to address general requirements, as well as specific criteria around DIY or running
      </li>
      <li>
        Preparing a comprehensive on-boarding for participants, including technical explanations and providing research background
      </li>
      <li>
        Recruiting across Seattle DIY and running communities
      </li>
      <li>
        Skype interviews with participants to on-board and explain our process
      </li>
    </ul>

      Running the Study, Surveying, and Interviewing
    </h2>
    <p>
      After two weeks of recruitment, we reached our goal of organizing 15 participants who would use the application and share progress with their friends or family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of the next 5 weeks, we met as a team and worked to accomplish some key tasks:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Discussing emerging findings based on our participants' patterns of use
      </li>
      <li>
        Crafting weekly surveys to explore participants' perceptions
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussing key interview criteria and progressively building a final interview script based on our participants' feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reaching out to participants who dropped-off, and replacing them if and when they decided to leave the study
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducting final interviews with our participants. Each team member interviewed about 5 participants for an hour to explore their feedback
      </li>
    </ul>

      Focusing our Interviews around our Research Questions
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of our primary efforts during this time was discussing and honing our interview approach to direct participant discussions towards our research questions, and away from issues related to bugs or visual designs in the app. These issues proved to be distracting for some participants, and we mitigated them by:
    </p>
    <ul class="work-body-list">
      <li>
        Creating a space for participants to voice their feedback related to bugs or visual issues; listening intently and honestly to their concerns
      </li>
      <li>
        Candidly explaining that the application would not go to market, and that we were interested in understanding their feelings about sharing and feedback
      </li>
      <li>
        Connecting their experience on Yarn to commercial tools; if a feature showed errors on Yarn, how would they have responded to it instead on a more commercial app like Runkeeper?
      </li>
    </ul>

      Analyzing our Findings
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the period from March - June 2018, we'll be analyzing our findings. Check back soon for more information as we continue to update the publication under review.
